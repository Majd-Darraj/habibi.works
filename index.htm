        <h2>Who we are!</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Habibi.Works, an intercultural maker space and platform for
          education, empowerment and encounters for refugees and Greek locals in
          the North of Greece! We work at eye level with people. We support them
          to create solutions themselves. We listen to their ideas instead of
          telling them what to do. We encourage them to share their skills and
          expertise. Habibi.Works is a living example of the values we would
          like to see in our societies: respect, solidarity, equality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Habibi.Works was founded by our small German NGO Soup and Socks e.V.
          in 2016 as an intercultural FabLab, designed to bring refugees, locals
          and international experts together to create products and
          perspectives. In concrete terms, Habibi.Works is a 700m2 space,
          consisting of 11 different working areas in which people create,
          learn, teach and meet.
